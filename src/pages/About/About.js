                <p><b>100% of the above statements are complete guesses</b> <span role="img" aria-label="laughing-emoji">ðŸ˜‚</span>
                &nbsp;, but I'd imagine its somewhere close to reality. Don't quote me.</p>
                <p>Point is, we are spending a lot of time at our desks these days.</p>
                <p>There are many reasons to optimize our desk setup - health/ergonomics, productivity, performance, to name a few.</p>
                <p>While there are thousands of sites that give product recommendations, they're not as genuine as hearing
                    about a product from your friend, or from somone who has actually used the product for a while.</p>
                <p>It's why <a href="https://yourstack.com/">YourStack</a> is so cool.</p>
                <p>There are many similar sites to this one: <a href="https://deskhunt.com/">DeskHunt</a>, <a href="https://mysetup.co/">MySetup</a>,
                    <a href="https://kit.co/"> Kit.co</a>.</p>
                <p>That being said, I'm still not quite sure what the differentiating factor for this site will be haha.</p>
