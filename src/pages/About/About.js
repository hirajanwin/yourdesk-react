                    <p>As of August 2020, </p>
                    <p>85% of employees work from home,</p>
                    <p>5% of companies are fully remote,</p>
                    <p>99% of gamers have a home setup,</p>
                    <p>and 75% of students attend school remote.</p>
                    <p><b>100% of the above statements are complete guesses</b>, but I'd imagine its somewhat close to reality. Don't quote me.</p>
